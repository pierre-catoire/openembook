## What are the potential adverse effects of ultrasound?

As for now, no case of ultrasound-related injury secondary to medical imaging has been reported. However, theoretical principles suggest that there may be adverse effects of ultrasound imaging if the device is not set properly. A precaution principle imposes therefore to pay attention to the device settings and to monitor the potential effects of the ultrasounds.

**Theoretical** adverse effects of ultrasound imaging include:

-   Mechanical effects
-   Thermal effects

## Mechanical effects

When ultrasounds propagate through water, they create shear forces of compression and dilation. When these forces are high enough, they can result in **cavitation**, causing damage to surrounding tissues.

Risk of mechanical damages is increased by:

-   High amplitude
-   Low frequency: high frequencies do not allow enough time for the cavitation to appear
-   High Pulse Rate Frequency (PRF, ie. number of ultrasound wavefronts emitted per second)
-   Narrower scan area (causing more pulses per second)
-   Narrow focus

In daily practice, risk of mechanical injury is monitored by the **Mechanical Index (MI)**. Guidelines recommend to maintain:

-   MI lower than 1.9 in any case, and lower than 0.23 for ophtalmology exam
-   For obstetrics: maintain MI under 0.7 in any case, and reduce time of exposure for MIs between 0.3 and 0.7

## Thermal effects

Energy dispersed among tissues by ultrasound result in increase of heat. Tissue sensitivity to such effect is heterogenous, with bones, lens, cornea, tendons and adipose tissues being the most sensitive.

Risk of thermal damages is increased by:

- Higher frequency
- Higher amplitude
- Longer pulse duration
- Longer time of exposure
- Narrower scan area
- Narrow focus

Risk of thermal injury is monitored by the **Thermal Index (TI)**. Guidelines recommend to:

- Maintain TI under 3.0 in any case
- Reduce time exposure as low as possible for TI between 0.7 and 3.0
