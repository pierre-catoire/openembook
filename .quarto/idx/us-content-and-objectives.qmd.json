Course objectives and modules\n\n### General objectives\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n\n-   explain how an echograph uses ultrasounds to create both static and dynamic images\n-   choose the adequate probe, mode and settings\n-   manipulate the ultrasound probe to obtain the needed view\n-   explore different body sections (chest, abdomen, limbs) to identify life-threatening injuries\n-   guide insertion of catheter with ultrasound\n-   integrate the ultrasound observation into clinical decision-making\n-   enhance clinical triage of wounded using ultrasound assessment\n\n### Specific objectives by module\n\n#### Module 1: Fundamentals of ultrasound\n\n-   What is an ultrasound\n-   How ultrasounds are emitted, propagated, diffused, transmitted, reflected and transducted\n-   How is produced the image shown on screen\n-   How to choose the adequate probe\n-   How to choose the adequate mode\n-   How to interpret ultrasound artefacts\n-   What are the adverse effects of ultrasound\n\n#### Module 2: Handling the probe\n\n-   How to prepare the patient and yourself for an ultrasound exam\n-   How to set the ultrasound device to obtain the best image quality\n-   Orientating the view shown on screen\n-   Move the probe to find the best view\n\n#### Module 3: Abdomen\n\n-   Identify intraperitoneal free fluid using the FAST protocol\n-   Identify signs of renal pelvis dilatation\n-   Identify abdominal aortic aneuvrism\n-   Identify US-guided Murphy sign for cholelithiasis or cholecystitis\n-   Look for intrauterine pregnancy\n\n#### Module 4: Lungs\n\n-   Explain what are the significance of lung ultrasound semiology: A-lines, B-lines, lung sliding, lung point, free fluid, condensation\n-   Integrate these signs to diagnose: pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiogenic edema, pneumonia\n\n#### Module 5: Bones and tissues\n\n-   Describe on which bones and which kind of fractures can be diagnosed with ultrasound\n-   Identify a fracture on these bones\n-   Identify a foreign body in soft tissues\n\n#### Module 6: Heart\n\n-   Obtain the main views of the heart: parasternal long and short axis, apical (4-chamber), subcostal\n-   Assess the left ventricular ejection fraction by both visual semi-quantitative and MAPSE methods\n-   Look for signs of severe acute pulmonary embolism\n-   Identify free pericardial fluid\n-   Identify signs of massive valvular regurgitation\n-   Measure the inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility\n\n#### Module 7: Vessels\n\n-   Visualize and follow arteries and veins\n-   Diagnose deep vein thrombosis\n-   Guide a puncture in a vessel through both in-plane, out-of-plane and oblique approaches\n\n#### The T-FAST protocol\n\n-   Describe what is the T-FAST protocol and why it has been designed\n-   Describe the potential and limits of the T-FAST protocol\n-   How to use the T-FAST for individual patient assessment and triage\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## What will I learn?\n\nThe
