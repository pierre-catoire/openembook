Frequency is mostly measured in **Hertz (Hz)**, indicating the number of cycles per **second**.\n\nThe frequency is related to the **period** of the wave, which is the **duration** of a cycle. The frequency and period are related:\n\n$$\nFrequency = \\frac{1}{Period}\n$$\n\nFor example, a wave with a frequency of 2 Hz (meaning, two cycles per second) has a period of 0.5 seconds ($\\frac{1}{2}$). A wave with a frequency of 40 Hz has a period of 0.025 seconds ($\\frac{1}{40}$) or 25 milliseconds.\n\n### Energy of the ultrasounds\n\nThe **energy** of an ultrasound depends on both the frequency and the amplitude:\n\n-   the higher the frequency, the higher the energy\n-   the higher the amplitude, the higher the energy\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Why it matters?\n\nChoosing wisely the frequency and amplitude is essential to obtain the best image quality while limiting the potential adverse effects (see after).\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"us-ultrasound-101.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"darkly","title":"Ultrasound 101"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
