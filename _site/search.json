Frequency is mostly measured in Hertz (Hz), indicating the number of cycles per second.\n\nThe frequency is related to the period of the wave, which is the duration of a cycle. The frequency and period are related:\n\\[\nFrequency = \\frac{1}{Period}\n\\]\nFor example, a wave with a frequency of 2 Hz (meaning, two cycles per second) has a period of 0.5 seconds (\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). A wave with a frequency of 40 Hz has a period of 0.025 seconds (\\(\\frac{1}{40}\\)) or 25 milliseconds.\n\n\n\nThe energy of an ultrasound depends on both the frequency and the amplitude:\n\nthe higher the frequency, the higher the energy\nthe higher the amplitude, the higher the energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters?\n\n\n\nChoosing wisely the frequency and amplitude is essential to obtain the best image quality while limiting the potential adverse effects (see after)."

    "text": "Attenuation and diffusion\nAs the ultrasound frontwave is spheric, it growths over distance and time. Hence, the energy is distributed on a wider surface and therefore, the amount of energy per surface unit on the wavefront is decreasing. This is called dissipation.\nFurthermore, as the motion of molecules is not perfectly orientated, ultrasounds create chaotic movement of the molecules (ie, brownian motion). This translates to heat in the system, which implies loss of energy of the wave. This is called diffusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe energy of ultrasound is attenuated, ie. decreased over time and distance, by:\n\ndissipation: spreading of the energy on a wider wavefront\ndiffusion: transfer of kinetic energy to heat in the tissues\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that:\n\n\n\nThe attenuation is dependent on the frequency: the higher the frequency, the higher the attenuation. Therefore:\n\nHigh frequencies are used for superficial exams\nLow frequencies are used for deep exams\n\n\n\nAs long as the ultrasound travels through an homogenous medium (e.g. water), its direction is only frontward. When the wavefront hits an object (ie, another medium, e.g. fat, bone, air), it splits the wave in two:\n\none is going back to the probe: it is the reflected wave\none is pursuing through the new medium: it is the transmitted wave\n\nNote that the sum of the energy of the two waves (reflected and transmitted) is equal to the energy of the incident wave."

When the ultrasound hits a target, it splits into a transmitted wave pursuing its trajectory, and a reflected wave travelling back to the probe.\nBased on these informations, could you guess how basically an ultrasound device can locate targets in the body?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultrasound identifies targets by:\n\nemitting ultrasound\nreceiving reflected waves\nmeasuring the time of travel of the ultrasound (ie. the time between emission and reception of reflected waves)\ncalculating the distance of the target hit by the formula:\n\n\\[\nDistance = \\frac{Transit \\ time}{2} \\times Speed\n\\]\n\n\n\nBy emitting ultrasounds in various directions, the ultrasound probe can identify targets in the all exploration space. Thereafter, the ultrasound device plots the image by representing any echo (ie. reflected ultrasound) by a white dot, creating an image representing the explorated section of the body.\nHowever, more details are required to understand more precisely how the ultrasound device works:\n\non what depends the intensity of the reflection?\nwhat happens if a second target is beyond the first one?\nHow does the probe emits ultrasounds in different directions?"

    "text": "The phased-array probe\nHowever, for chest and skull, use of curvilinear probe would be limited by the presence of bones. The probe surface should be narrow to limit the interposition of bones. In this situation, the probe will emit ultrasound in various directions not using curvature of the surface, but a technology called phased array. This probe is called the sectorial probe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a phased array?\n\n\n\nA phased-array probe uses phase shifting to change the direction of ultrasounds emitted from a flat surface."
